# FTC Strings
# 
# This file contains the strings used by the FTC Scoring application.  The key
# on the left side is used by the code and is then mapped to the value on the
# right.  The lines with the # character are comments.  The comment above each
# line describes the string and how it is used.
#
# For a new language, a copy of this file should be saved with the two character
# language code.  (Based on the ISO-639 standard which can be found at, 
# http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt)  Translate the values
# of the strings to the appropriate strings for that language.  
#
# To use the new language there are two options:
#   1) Open FTCScoring.Properties Create an entry for "language", set it to the
#      2 letter language code used for the filename.
#   2) If the language field is not set, the Scoring system will try to set the
#      language to the language specified by the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
